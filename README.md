# cryptopals.com Challenges

Here's are my solutions to some of [the cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).

The structure of the project:

- library code located under the `cryptopals` module
- tests for each challenge under the `tests` module

This was a lot of fun. However, as time went on, I felt like it was increasingly difficult
to follow what that challenges were asking me to do. In other words, they got pretty.... cryptic. ðŸ¤“
They could use an editing overhaul.

## Setup

1. Have Python 3.9 or greater.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the challenges

Run the tests (i.e. challenges) with `pytest tests`.
